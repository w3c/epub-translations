# Repository for Authorized EPUB 3 Translations

This repository hosts the [“authorized translations”](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy) of the various EPUB Documents maintained by the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/). 

The term [“authorized translations”](https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy) refers to translations that get an official W3C “stamp”, go through a process of quality control, and are stored and referred to on the W3C servers. As a result they can be referred to for more formal purposes, as part of governmental regulations.
